# Features 
## Existing Features

- Timer: The main component of a STUDIMO is the timer, which allows users to set a 25-minute work session, followed by a 5-minute break.

- Reset button:  Allows users to restart or reset the timer. This feature can be useful when the user wants to repeat the Pomodoro cycle, for example, if they need to take a longer break or if they want to repeat the cycle with a different task.

## Features Left to Implement

- I would like to implement the capability to create an account for convenient tracking of all sessions conducted.
- I would like to incorporate the option to integrate with the calendar app for effective monitoring of future events.

## Colour Pallet

I chose to use various shades of blue for STUDIMO with the intention of helping students stay focused during their study sessions. There is no definitive scientific evidence to support the claim that blue is universally good for studying, but certain studies have suggested that blue may have a positive effect on cognitive performance and concentration for some people.

One potential reason why blue may be beneficial for studying is its calming and soothing properties. Blue is often associated with feelings of relaxation and tranquility, which can help reduce stress and anxiety levels that might otherwise interfere with focus and productivity. By promoting a sense of calm, blue may help students concentrate on their work more effectively and for longer periods of time.

Another possible reason why blue might be beneficial for studying is that it can help stimulate the brain and enhance mental alertness. Blue is a highly stimulating color that has been shown to increase brain activity and cognitive function, which can improve memory recall and the ability to process information. This increased brain activity may help students better retain and recall important information when studying.

Overall, while the effects of blue may vary from person to person, incorporating blue into your study environment, such as through the use of blue lighting or accents, may be worth considering if you find it helps you focus and concentrate better.
