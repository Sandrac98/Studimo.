# Features 
## Existing Features

- Timer: The main component of a STUDIMO is the timer, which allows users to set a 25-minute work session, followed by a 5-minute break.

- Reset button:  Allows users to restart or reset the timer. This feature can be useful when the user wants to repeat the Pomodoro cycle, for example, if they need to take a longer break or if they want to repeat the cycle with a different task.

## Features Left to Implement

- I would like to implement the capability to create an account for convenient tracking of all sessions conducted.
- I would like to incorporate the option to integrate with the calendar app for effective monitoring of future events.

## Colour Pallet

I chose to use various shades of blue for STUDIMO with the intention of helping students stay focused during their study sessions. Blue is a color that is known to evoke feelings of calm, tranquility, and stability, which makes it a perfect choice for spaces where relaxation is encouraged, such as bedrooms and bathrooms. Furthermore, blue is associated with freedom, imagination, and inspiration, making it an ideal color for creative and innovative environments, as it is believed to enhance the mind and foster self-expression. Moreover, the color blue has been shown to have a soothing effect on both the body and mind, making it a great choice for promoting balance and overall well-being.
